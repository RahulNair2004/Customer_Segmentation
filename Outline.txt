### Key Segments for Customer Clustering

When segmenting customers using clustering algorithms (like K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering), the features you choose depend on your business goals. Below are common customer segmentation approaches:

---

## 1. **RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value)**  
- **Objective:** Identify high-value customers, loyal customers, or inactive customers.  
- **Features:**  
   - **Recency:** Days since the last purchase.  
   - **Frequency:** Number of purchases made.  
   - **Monetary Value:** Total spending by the customer.  
- **Why:** Provides insight into customer behavior patterns.

**Example Segments:**  
- VIP Customers  
- Loyal Customers  
- At-Risk Customers  
- Lost Customers  

---

## 2. **Purchase Behavior Analysis**  
- **Objective:** Understand what types of products customers are buying and their purchase habits.  
- **Features:**  
   - **Product Categories Purchased**  
   - **Average Basket Size (Quantity per Order)**  
   - **Average Order Value**  
- **Why:** Helps optimize product recommendations and inventory management.

**Example Segments:**  
- Bulk Buyers  
- Occasional Buyers  
- Seasonal Shoppers  

---

## 3. **Demographic Segmentation**  
- **Objective:** Segment customers based on demographic details.  
- **Features:**  
   - **Country**  
   - **Age (if available)**  
   - **Gender (if available)**  
- **Why:** Personalize marketing strategies based on demographic insights.

**Example Segments:**  
- Region-Specific Buyers  
- Age Group Preferences  

---

## 4. **Engagement Segmentation**  
- **Objective:** Understand how actively customers are interacting with your platform.  
- **Features:**  
   - **Frequency of Visits**  
   - **Time Spent per Visit**  
   - **Response to Promotions/Emails**  
- **Why:** Helps identify highly engaged customers versus dormant ones.

**Example Segments:**  
- Active Users  
- Inactive Users  
- Promotion-Responsive Customers  

---

## Suggested Approach  
For your dataset, the most actionable approach would be **RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value)** because the dataset contains transaction data with InvoiceDate, CustomerID, Quantity, and UnitPrice.

Would you like me to proceed with RFM segmentation, or do you have a different segmentation focus in mind?
